this project aims to build a self-driving car using the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator. The simulator provides a virtual environment for testing autonomous vehicle algorithms, allowing developers to collect data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

The code is written in Python 3 and uses TensorFlow and Keras libraries for training the neural network.

#Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

Python 3

TensorFlow

Keras

NumPy

OpenCV

SocketIO

Flask

#Udacity Simulator

The Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator can be downloaded from the Udacity GitHub repository. The simulator includes two tracks, one for training and one for testing, and provides a number of different camera angles to collect data.

#Neural Network Architecture

The neural network used in this project consists of the following layers:

Input layer

Convolutional layer with 24 filters

Max pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2

Convolutional layer with 36 filters

Max pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2

Convolutional layer with 48 filters

Max pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2

Convolutional layer with 64 filters

Max pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2

Convolutional layer with 64 filters

Flatten layer

Fully connected layer with 100 units

Fully connected layer with 50 units

Fully connected layer with 10 units

Output layer with 1 unit (steering angle)

#Training the Neural Network

To train the neural network, first collect data using the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator. The simulator allows you to drive the car manually while recording the car's behavior and camera data. The data is saved in a CSV file that includes the steering angle, throttle, brake, and speed.

Once you have collected enough data, split the data into a training set and a validation set, and use it to train the neural network using the train.py script. You can modify the hyperparameters in the script to adjust the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

#Testing the Self-Driving Car

Once you have trained the neural network, start the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator in autonomous mode and run the drive.py script to connect to the simulator and send the steering angle commands to the car. The drive.py script receives the camera data from the simulator, pre-processes the data, feeds it into the neural network, and sends the predicted steering angle back to the simulator
