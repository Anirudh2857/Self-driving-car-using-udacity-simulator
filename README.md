# Autonomous Driving Data Processing and Augmentation

## Overview
This project processes and augments image data for training an autonomous driving model. The dataset includes images captured from a car simulator, along with steering angle data. The goal is to balance the dataset, preprocess images, and apply augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset.

## Features
- Loads and processes the dataset from a CSV file containing image paths and steering angles.
- Balances the dataset by reducing overrepresented steering angle bins.
- Splits the dataset into training and validation sets.
- Performs various image augmentation techniques:
  - Zooming
  - Panning
  - Brightness adjustment
  - Horizontal flipping
- Visualizes the dataset distribution and augmentation results.

## Requirements
The following dependencies are required to run the script:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib keras scikit-learn imgaug opencv-python
```

## File Structure
- `track/driving_log.csv` - CSV file containing image paths and corresponding driving data, generated by training and recording the car in the Udacity simulator.
- `track/IMG/` - Folder containing images captured during driving simulation.
- `script.py` - Main script performing data processing and augmentation.

## How to Run
1. Ensure that the dataset (`driving_log.csv` and `IMG/` folder) is available in the `track/` directory.
2. Run the script to preprocess data and apply augmentation:

```bash
python drive.py
```

## Explanation of Key Functions
### `path_leaf(path)`
Extracts the filename from a given file path.

### `load_img_steering(datadir, df)`
Loads image paths and corresponding steering angles, including left and right camera images with adjusted steering values.

### `zoom(image)`
Applies random zoom augmentation.

### `pan(image)`
Applies random translation (panning) to the image.

### `img_random_brightness(image)`
Adjusts image brightness randomly.

### `img_random_flip(image, steering_angle)`
Flips the image horizontally and inverts the steering angle.

### `random_augment(image, steering_angle)`
Applies a combination of random augmentations to an image.

## Output
- Balanced dataset for training an autonomous driving model.
- Augmented images for enhanced model generalization.
- Visualizations of dataset distribution and augmentation effects.
