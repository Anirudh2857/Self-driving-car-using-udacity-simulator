Self Driving Cars have become common around the world these days. The Self Driving Car functions on the concepts of Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks and Image Processing. With the help of the simulation, a car manufacturer can produce the desiered result. First, with the help of the arrow keys on the keyboard train your car on the udacity simulator record. When you press the record button it records all the possible angles, as cameras are present on all the sides of the car. With the help of the angles recorded while training the model, using the code above perform the self drive. Change the X and Y co-ordinates, based on your training model.
